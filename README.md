Compared  two excel sheets for ID matches. Dumped Excel information into text files. Compared IDs of ids.txt,
to the IDs in ids2.txt. If a match was found, input the zipcode into the new sheet and show how many matches in
the console, if any. This was a private freelance project so the full excel sheet data isn't shown, and instead,
just the text files with the necessary information is given.
